what we were trying to do.

# Which K Performed Best
We can't say which specific k performed the best
based on the plot we have. Some performed well while others
didn't. There were also a lot of repeat values which is probably
due to us using inaccurate parameters for the score function from the 
KNeighborsClassifier. (Side Note: Running the program each times gives
different plot charts and accuracy values due built-in shuffle of
KNeighborsClassifier)
